    # Nguyen Khanh Linh, Ms.
    ## Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Voice of LinkedIn '24

    With 13+ years of experience in **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science**, and Object-oriented programming, I bring a strong foundation to any project. My expertise extends to **MLOps**, and **software development cycle** with over 5 years of hands-on experience. As a part-time **researcher** at *DataScience-Works* lab in Australia, I stay at the forefront of industry trends and advancements. Currently serve as **Google Developers Group's Ambassador** and **advisor** to various C-levels of organizations.

    ## Key Skills
    - **Programming**: Python, MATLAB, Java, C/C++
    - **NLP**: Topic modeling, document summarization, extraction, categorization, sentiment analysis, dialogue systems, generation, and neural machine translation
    - **Machine Learning**: Statistical modeling, probability theory, decision trees, ensemble methods, SVM, using frameworks like Keras, Gensim, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
    - **Deep Learning**: RNN, LSTM, CNN, MemN2N, BERT, and other Transformer variations (e.g., BART, GPTs)
    - **MLOps & ML Platform**: End-to-end pipeline development with feature stores and serving pipelines using AWS SageMaker and Databricks in Datalake ecosystems
    - **Optimization**: Expertise in mathematical optimization (convex/concave, linear problem, large-scale) and LLM optimization techniques (Unsloth, FlashAttention, PEFT, LoRA/QLoRA)
    - **LLM-RAG/Agentic LLMs Development**: Full end-to-end offline and cloud LLM-RAG development & deployment using Langchain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, and LocalAI
