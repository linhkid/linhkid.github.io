# Conferences

<div class="event-container">
   <h3 class="event-title">International AI-Semiconductor Conference - AISC 2025 </h3>
   <div class="event-meta">AISC 2025 - Startup Live Demo section</div>
   <img src="/assets/img/aisc2.jpeg" alt="AISC 2025" class="event-image">
   <div class="event-description">
The AI-Semiconductor Conference 2025 (AISC 2025) is a groundbreaking international event taking place March 12–14, 2025 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Organized by the Industrial AI Federation, AISC 2025 emerges as a global convergence of AI and semiconductor innovations. This inaugural event promises high-level discussions, keynotes from renowned technologists and industry CEOs, technical sessions, and networking receptions, offering attendees unique insights into how AI is reshaping the semiconductor industry—and vice versa. 

I had the privilege of presenting on stage at AISC 2025 before a sizable audience of industry leaders and influential guests. While most other startups opted for precautionary pre-recorded demos, I decided to go live and set up a real-time demonstration of Obello’s platform in just a few minutes. The crowd response and feedback were overwhelmingly positive, and it truly reinforced the value and impact of our solution.</div>

# Teachings

<div class="event-container">
    <h3 class="event-title">Database Concepts and Skills for Big Data</h3>
    <div class="event-meta">VinUniversity, Hanoi - June 2023</div>
    <img src="/assets/img/vinuni23.JPG" alt="Guest Lecture at VinUniversity" class="event-image">
    <div class="event-description">
        <p>Delivered a comprehensive guest lecture to Computer Science students at VinUniversity, Vietnam's premier private university, focusing on modern database architectures and big data practices. The session covered crucial topics including data modeling, distributed databases, and real-world applications of big data technologies.</p>

        <p>The lecture combined theoretical foundations with practical insights, demonstrating how different database paradigms (SQL, NoSQL, Vector DBs) serve different business needs. Students learned about data warehousing, data lakes, and the emergence of data lakehouses, with special emphasis on scaling considerations and performance optimization. The session included interactive demonstrations of database design patterns and their applications in AI/ML pipelines.</p>

   <h3 class="event-title">Bridging the Gap between AI Research & Production</h3>
   <div class="event-meta">Hanoi University of Science - March 2023</div>
   <img src="/assets/img/hus23.JPG" alt="Guest Lecture at HUS" class="event-image">
   <div class="event-description">
       <p>Delivered an insightful lecture to Computer Science students at Hanoi University of Science about the challenges and solutions in transitioning AI models from research to production environments. Drawing from my experience at Techcombank, A*STAR and Shopee, demonstrated how theoretical AI concepts translate into real-world applications.</p>

       <p>The session focused on practical MLOps practices, covering model deployment, monitoring, and maintenance in production environments. Students learned about the importance of scalability, reproducibility, and maintaining model performance in real-world conditions. Special emphasis was placed on the differences between academic metrics and business KPIs, and how to bridge this gap effectively.</p>
