        <h3 class="project-title">LLM & GenAI Projects at Obello</h3>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/img/obello_banner.png" alt="Obello Banner">
    <p>As Head of AI at Obello, I lead the development of state-of-the-art generative AI models for graphic design and content creation. Our platform enables design and marketing teams to create on-brand content 10 times faster than traditional methods. Key achievements include implementing advanced prompt engineering techniques, developing custom fine-tuning pipelines for design-specific tasks, and creating robust evaluation metrics for generated content.</p>

        <h3 class="project-title">Crafting Resilient AI: A Hands-on Workshop on Attacks, Defenses, and Alignment
</h3>
    </div>
    <img src="/assets/img/resilient ai.jpg" alt="Crafting Resilient AI">
    <p>This project delves into the critical field of AI Alignment and Safety, exploring the challenges and opportunities surrounding the development of responsible, robust, and beneficial artificial intelligence. Using Keras and TensorFlow, audiences will learn firsthand how to implement the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FSGM) to launch attacks on image recognition models. Then,  they will dive into practical solutions with Gemma and Shield Gemma, powerful tools designed to safeguard AI systems and ensure their ethical deployment.</p>

    </div>
    <img src="/assets/img/ai_alignment_24.jpg" alt="Pressure-Sense Architecture">
    <p>Developed as part of the AI Safety Fundamentals course at BlueDot Impact, this research project investigates how AI systems understand and respond to pressure, both in terms of performance and ethical considerations. The project includes implementation of novel testing frameworks, development of pressure-resistant architectures, and comprehensive documentation of ethical implications in AI system responses under various pressure scenarios.</p>

    </div>
    <img src="/assets/img/gemma_twin.jpg" alt="Gemma Twin">
    <p>The world of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often perceived as a playground for tech giants, with complex models requiring vast resources. But what about making these powerful tools accessible to everyone (hint: making Large Language Models smaller, so we can call it SLM or MLM)? Enter Gemma, Google's open-source family of lightweight LLMs (for these I call them Small Language Model for their 2B version, and Medium Language Models for their 7B/9B versions), designed to bring the power of Gemini to a wider audience. Libraries/tools used: Gemma, Unsloth, LoRA, PEFT, FlashAttention.</p>

    </div>
    <img src="/assets/img/antoan.ai-fellowship.png" alt="AI Safety Vietnam Fellowship">
    <p>Advanced AI systems are coming, and leading AI experts have warned about catastrophic, even existential, risks that may potentially arise from these systems.</p>
    <p>We (antoan.ai - AI Safety Vietnam) are partnering with Hanoi AI Safety Network to offer a Summer Research Fellowship focused on the technical aspects of AI safety. Previous participants have published research at ICLR, ICML, and AAAI. Projects span safety evaluations, interpretability, AI control, adversarial robustness, and more.</p>
    <p>We review applications on a rolling basis, with the deadline to apply being Monday July 28th 23:59 AOE.</p>
